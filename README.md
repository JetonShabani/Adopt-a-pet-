# Adopt-a-pet-Exercise on Code Academy 
In this project, I´ll have the opportunity to practice using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application.
 Specifically, I´ll be building a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.
